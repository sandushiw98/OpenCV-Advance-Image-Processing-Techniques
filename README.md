# OpenCV for Image Processing

## Overview
This repository contains examples and code snippets from the article "Unlocking the Power of OpenCV for Image Processing" by Sandushi Weraduwa. It demonstrates how OpenCV can be used for various image processing tasks, which are crucial in deep learning applications.

## Features
- **Basic Image Processing**: Code for reading, displaying, and saving images.
- **Image Manipulations**: Examples of rotating, resizing, and cropping images.
- **Color Conversions**: Snippets for converting RGB images to grayscale.
- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - **Edge Detection**: Using the Canny algorithm to detect edges.
  - **Image Filtering**: Applying Gaussian and Median filters to enhance images.
  - **Morphological Operations**: Performing dilation and erosion.

## Installation
To use these scripts, you need to install OpenCV. Run:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
